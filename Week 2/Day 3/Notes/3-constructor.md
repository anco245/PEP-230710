# Constructor
- special method defined in a class
- initializes the state of a newly created object
- has no return type
- name is the same of the class
- a no-args constructor is created for you behind the scenes

---

# Parameterized Constructors
- you can have more than one constructor IF they have different parameter lists
- having 1+ constructors is useful for flexibility
- if you create your own constructor, you lose the no-args
