# Object Oriented Programming
- approach to solving programming problems by creating entities that model real-world objects
- these entities, called objects, can interact with one another 

---

# Class
- blueprint for creating objects
- class members: variables, methods, constructors
- variables and methods that are NOT static are instance members

---

# Object
- instance members are copied by objects and can only be interacted with using an object of the class
- instance variables are known as "state" that objects can have
- instance methods are known as "behavior" that objects can have
