# Static Scope
- scope: where a variable or method is exists
- class member: variable or method defined in a class
- use the **static** keyword to make a member static
- why use static? to access a class member without needing an object

---

# How to use?
- within same class: just use name of member
- in another class: use class name and then name of member using dot notation
- ex) Math.min(4, 5)
- ex) Math.PI
