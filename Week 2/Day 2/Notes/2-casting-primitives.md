# Casting Primitives
- changing the datatype of a primitive value from one compatible type to another

---

# Downcasting
- AKA narrowing or explicit casting
- Java will notice you have a value that *may* not fit into a smaller type and will not like it
- you'll have to tell Java that's what you want to happen

---

# Upcasting
- AKA widening or implicit casting
- Java will notice you have a value that will *definitely* fit into the larger datatype
- Java will cast for you behind the scenes
