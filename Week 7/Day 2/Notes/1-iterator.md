# Iterators
- objects that allow you to traverse a Collection
- are used "behind the scenes" in enhanced for loops

---

# Iterator Methods
- hasNext()
- next()
- remove() (can only be called on modifiable Collections!)
- you cannot modify using Collection methods during iteration!

---

# List Iterator
- additionally has operations that use indexes
- can iterate backwards
- nextIndex()
- previousIndex()
- previous()
- hasPrevious()
