# Collections
- data structure: construct used to store, retreive, and process a group of values in a specialized way
- Java has the Collection API that implements common data structures

# Important Interfaces
- Iterable: requires that subtypes must be iterable so it can be traversed using a for-each loop
- Collection: defines common behavior that all subtypes should have (add, remove, contains, etc)
- Set: defines set-specific behaviors
- List: defines list-specific behaviors
- Queue: defines queue-specific behaviors
- Map: not part of actual hierarchy, but part of it in spirit. defines map-specific behaviors
