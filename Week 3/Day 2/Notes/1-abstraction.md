# Abstraction
- introducing only essential functionality to client and hiding unnecessary details
- creating interfaces that define **what** functionality is guaranteed without needing to define **how** that functionality will be implemented
- enables creating flexible "lego-block" or "loosely-coupled" software
- ex) when we use external code, we don't know how method implementations, we just go off of method names, descriptions, and parameter list/return types
---

# Abstract Class
- interface for group of related classes
- define common state and behavior in abstract class

---

# Interface
