# Unit Testing with JUnit
- testing that methods behavior as intended
- typically several tests for one method
- Tests have a lifecycle
- Tests use assertions

---

# Common Assertions
- assertTrue and assertFalse
- assertNotNull and assertNull
- assertThrows
- assertSame and assertNotSame
- assertEquals and assertNotEquals

---

# Test Driven Development
- test first, implement afterward
- forces you to work incrementally
- forces you to keep it simple!

---

# Best Practices
- methods being tested should have one single purpose
- 1 assertion per test
- deterministic tests (result should be the same given the same input)
