# Encapsulation
- bundling state + behavior together
- restricting access to class members using access modifiers

---

# Levels of Access
- public
- protected
- default (no modifier)
- private

---

# Getters and Setters
- one method for retrieving the state's value
- one method for manipulating the state's value
- data can be read only or completely inaccessible outside of class
- you can enforce manipulation rules in a single method
