# Polymorphism
- an entity having multiple forms
- method overloading and overriding
- polymorphic casting

---

# Method Overloading
- occurs within a class
- same method, different parameter lists
- useful for if an argument could be optional

---

# Method Overriding
- spans a subtype class and a supertype class
- subtype implementation of a method can differ from parent implementation
- useful for having general and specific versions of a behavior

---

# Polymorphic casting
- using a subtype object with supertype reference
- works because a subtype "IS-A" type of supertype
- state and behavior that supertype reference expects will be guaranteed in subtype object
