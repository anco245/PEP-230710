# Lambdas
- short lived, in-line implementation of a functional interface
- a lot of the syntax for creating a lambda can be omitted for conciseness

# Method references
- lambda with even shorter syntax
- can be used if all you need to perform is a method call quickly
- 4 types: on an static method, instance method, arbitrary object, and constructor
